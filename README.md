# Scarabs-ABM
----

This is a Master's thesis project, meant to derive animal tracks from available dung beetle footage and integrate these tracks into an agent-based model that intends to describe and predict behaviour of the beetles. The project consists of three parts: extraction of dung beetle trajectories from videos, an agent-based model of dung-beetle behaviour, and sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation of the agent-based model using the dung beetle trajectories. All of these parts can be executed separately, given that there is appropriate data at hand.
